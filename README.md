# Arsène Brou 

👋🏽 Welcome to my webpage 

I am thrilled to be here as a Ph.D. candidate in Quantitative Finance from Laval University. My passion lies in the dynamic intersection of Financial Econometrics and Simulation-based Inference, where I explore applications in Forecasting, Portfolio Allocation, and Option Pricing.
