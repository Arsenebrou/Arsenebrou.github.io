    "text": "Greetings! I’m a doctoral candidate at the University Laval’s Department of Finance, Insurance and Real Estate, where I’m pursuing a PhD in finance. My main area of research and academic focus is on econometric methods related to time series, high-frequency data modeling, and the impact of macroeconomic announcements, as well as commodity financialization.\nTo study high-frequency financial data, I rely on the programming language R as my primary tool. At present, I’m working on my thesis, and I’m excited to be making progress on this significant research undertaking."

    "text": "GSF-3100 Capital market (Fall/Winter 2021)\nThe objective of this course is to analyze capital markets, their main financial instruments and their roles in the intermediation of funds and risk; to examine the role of financial institutions and supervisory agencies, particularly in the Canadian context; analyze the term structure of interest rates and the volatility of fixed income securities, government, corporate and international bond markets; study fixed income securities with optional clauses and the main financial markets for risk intermediation classified according to the instruments traded in them, i.e., asset-backed securities, futures, options and swaps markets\n\nSlide S01\nSlide S02\nSlide S03\nSlide S04\nSlide S05\nSlide S06\nSlide S07\nSlide S08\nSlide S09A\nSlide S09B\nSlide S09C\nSlide S10A\nSlide S10B\n\nGSF-6053 Financial Econometrics (Winter 2022)\nThis course familiarizes the student with the many practical dimensions of the use of econometric methods and estimation techniques in finance. Emphasis is placed on modeling problems and financial applications. Basic econometric models and concepts related to financial markets are presented. The student is expected to have acquired a basic knowledge of statistics.\n\nSlide S02\nSlide S03\nSlide S04\nSlide S05\nSlide S06\nSlide S07\nSlide S08\nSlide S09\nSlide S10\nSlide S11\nSlide S12\n\nGSF-1500 Financial Management (Summer 2022)\nThe course aims to introduce the future administrator to the principles and techniques of modern financial management. The teaching of theoretical models is focused on the current practice of corporate financial management. It serves mainly to develop the essential tools for decision-making. The principles and tools developed in this course are critically applied to key financial decisions: the choice of investments, the evaluation of the cost of capital and the choice of permanent financing (corporate capital structure and dividend policy)."

Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4009292 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4009292\nAbstract\nThe transition to a sustainable energy future requires considerable investments, which can be discouraged by heightened volatility in commodity markets. We investigate, using high-frequency data, the impact of macroeconomic announcements on commodity futures returns and volatility, while accounting for the financialization of commodities. We find that financialization lessens the impact of macro news on commodity markets, as measured by price drift and volatility changes. This result is consistent with prior literature suggesting that financial participants improve liquidity and price discovery while reducing volatility. Assuming that traditional market participants prefer stability, our results suggest a beneficial impact of financialization, especially for pro-cyclical commodities such as crude oil and natural gas.\n\nKeywords: commodities; futures; spillover; financialization; high-frequency; commercial; institutional; volatility; macro; announcements; surprise; events\nJEL Classification: E44, G13, G14, G15"
