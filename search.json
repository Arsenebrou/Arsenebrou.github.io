    "text": "GSF-3100 Capital market (Fall/Winter 2021)\nThe objective of this course is to analyze capital markets, their main financial instruments and their roles in the intermediation of funds and risk; to examine the role of financial institutions and supervisory agencies, particularly in the Canadian context; analyze the term structure of interest rates and the volatility of fixed income securities, government, corporate and international bond markets; study fixed income securities with optional clauses and the main financial markets for risk intermediation classified according to the instruments traded in them, i.e., asset-backed securities, futures, options and swaps markets\n\nSlide S01\nSlide S02\nSlide S03\nSlide S04\n\nGSF-6053 Financial Econometrics (Winter 2022)\nThis course familiarizes the student with the many practical dimensions of the use of econometric methods and estimation techniques in finance. Emphasis is placed on modeling problems and financial applications. Basic econometric models and concepts related to financial markets are presented. The student is expected to have acquired a basic knowledge of statistics.\n\nSlide S02\nSlide S03\nSlide S04\nSlide S05\n\nGSF-1500 Financial Management (Summer 2022)\nThe course aims to introduce the future administrator to the principles and techniques of modern financial management. The teaching of theoretical models is focused on the current practice of corporate financial management. It serves mainly to develop the essential tools for decision-making. The principles and tools developed in this course are critically applied to key financial decisions: the choice of investments, the evaluation of the cost of capital and the choice of permanent financing (corporate capital structure and dividend policy)."

    "text": "A simplified decomposition approach for evaluating stock return predictability (with Richard Luger)\nAbstract\nThe modelling approach in Anatolyev and Gospodinov (2010) decomposes asset returns into their signs and absolute values, and obtains the joint distribution by specifying a multiplicative error model for the absolute values, a dynamic binary choice model for the signs, and a bivariate copula for their interaction. With this copula-based approach, each component is specified conditional on past information. In this paper, we propose a simplified approach that recovers the dynamics of the joint distribution with a specification for the sign component that conditions on past information and the contemporaneous absolute value. In sharp contrast to the original decomposition model, the simplified approach avoids the need to specify a copula for joining a continuous margin with a discrete one. Simulation results demonstrate that the simplified approach does as well as copula-based specifications, and empirical findings show that a larger degree of stock return predictability is revealed by decomposition modelling than by traditional predictive regressions.\n\nKeywords: Predictive regression; Stock return predictability; Direction-of-change model; Absolute returns; Copula model\nJEL Classification: C13, C22, C51, G14"
